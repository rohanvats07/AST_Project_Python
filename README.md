AST assignment for Python Developer Role


Firstly I Web Scrapped the data of the website - https://books.toscrape.com/
(Indeed websote do not allow its site to be scrapped so I choose this and work on this)

After Scraping the website I uplaoded the data on my MongoDB database server.

After this I created a Djnago admin panel where I can see the books, add the new books form the panel and it will also get addded in to MongoDB database.
